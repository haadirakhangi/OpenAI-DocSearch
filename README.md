# OpenAI-DocSearch
OpenAI-DocSearch is a project that allows you to query any document and get relevant answers in seconds. Whether you want to find a specific piece of information, summarize the main points, or explore the document in depth, it can help you with its natural language processing capabilities. DocSearch uses OpenAI embeddings to encode and understand the document, and then generates responses based on your queries. You can use OpenAI-DocSearch for any type of document, such as articles, reports, books, or even web pages. DocSearch is a handy tool for anyone who wants to make the most out of their documents.
